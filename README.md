## Goal

Reach the Finish Flag using the shortest Path.

## Instruction

Run `python3 main.py`
Navigate with the arrow keys to drive the car.

## Cool stuff

You can use doors to teleport from one to another to find the shortest path.
Once you're done, the game will tell you if you used the shortest path or not.
It will then show you (animation) the shortest path.
